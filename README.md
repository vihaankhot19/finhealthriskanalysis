Project I made to determine the financial health and risk of a household
  - Can load a sample for a demo
  - Multiple tabs to truly understand where the household's financial position lies
  - Tab for methodology to show what methods I used (Monte Carlo Simulations, etc.)
  - Simplified main graphs into a normal distribution with a visible mean + standard deviation
  - Use this link: "https://vihaankhot19.github.io/finhealthriskanalysis/" to access the project
  - Thank you!!
